THREE.js for 3D Files Viewing

=============================

A responsive set of web content encapsulating the use of Three.js/WebGL for viewing .OBJ files from Blender.

I am hoping this set of files adds to the communities efforts to use WebGL to view 3D files from products such as Blender. The idea for this set of files came from my searches to try to find an easy mechanism to view 3D images on a web site. Hopefully they might help clarify for others how to get simple 3D images onto the web. My unreserved thats to the awesome open source communities, especially:
